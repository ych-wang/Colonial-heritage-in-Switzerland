Swiss merchants (among theme 15 from Berne, 11 from St.Gallen and 10 from Neuch\u00e2tel) were organised in the so-called \u00abnation suisse\u00bb. The following merchant families from St.Gallen were represented in Lyon: Zollikofer (Sollicoffre), Scherer, Schlumpf (Sellonf), Fitler, Locher, H\u00f6gger (Hogguer), Schobinger, Hochreutener (Horutener), Kunz (Cuentz), Wegelin, Kunkler (Councler), Studer, Scheitlin (Scheidlin), and Fingerlin (Finguerlin). From outside St.Gallen and unhampered by the city\u2019s guild regulations came the families of the Zellweger (Zellweguer) from Trogen AR and the Gonzenbach (Gonzebat) family from Hauptwil. Scheitlin and Fingerlin traded textiles with Cap Fran\u00e7ais (Saint-Domingue), and in 1750, Councler et Cie. made a deal with a trading house at Cap Fran\u00e7ais. 1717-1724, Jean Henri Gonzebat, partner in the merchant company \u00abSpecht et Gonzebat\u00bb, traded in textiles (mainly silkwares and cloth) and bullion (piastres) towards the Americas. Their European trading space comprised Paris and Geneva and such port (and triangular trade) cities as Marseilles, Bordeaux, La Rochelle, Nantes, Saint-Malo and Rouen. Jacques Christophe Gonzebat (1734-1777) from the same St.Gallen family became a merchant in Pondich\u00e9ry (French/British India), where he died at the age of 43. The brothers David and S\u00e9bastien Cuentz from St.Gallen started as a textile trading company in 1700. Around 1715, they went into banking, and their financial activities extended from Switzerland to southern Germany, northern Italy, southern France, Spain, and Holland, comprising such cities as Amsterdam, Marseilles, Paris, Saint-Malo, Barcelona, Madrid, Lisbon, Seville.
